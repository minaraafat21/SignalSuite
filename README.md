# SignalSuite Toolkit

## Overview
SignalSuite is a collection of signal processing tools designed for educational, research, and practical applications. This toolkit includes multiple standalone applications, each focusing on a specific aspect of signal processing, such as audio fingerprinting, signal equalization, Fourier Transform manipulation, sampling and reconstruction, and multi-port signal visualization. Together, these tools provide a robust platform for exploring and analyzing signals in various domains.

### 5. **Shazam-like App**
   - **Description**: An audio fingerprinting system inspired by Shazam. It identifies and classifies audio signals by generating unique fingerprints for each track and matching them against a repository.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Spectrogram generation for music, vocals, and full tracks.
     - Perceptual hashing for compact fingerprints.
     - Similarity matching with ranked results.
     - Audio blending and similarity analysis.
   - **Use Cases**: Music identification, audio signal analysis, and medical signal classification.
